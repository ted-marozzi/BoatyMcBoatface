## Explanation of the game

Mr. Boaty McBoatface, is a third person shooter that consists of three levels. In the game, the player controls a small toy boat, that can move around with the `WASD` buttons, and shoot cannons by pressing the `SPACE` button. The Camera is in a fixed position with respect to the boat, and rotates with the boat when the boat turns.

In the initial level, the boat is inside a bathtub in a bathroom, and it gets attacked by rubber ducks. The player needs to survive for a set amount of time to pass the level. The player can also shoot the ducks in order to survive. When the timer ends, the first level ends, and the next level begins.

In the second level, the boat is located in a big pool. This gives the player more room to play in. There are also the addition of enemy ships, which are programmed to shoot when they are a predetermined distance away from the player. If they are far away, they try to move towards the player. The player needs to survive without running out of health.

In the final level, the boat is located in an ocean and it is fighting against a giant rubber duck. This is the final boss of the game that the players will need to defeat in order to complete the game.

The game went through a few iterations with respect to how the player should move, how the camera should behave, and what the levels should look like. We experimented with various controls such as a free moving cam that can be controlled with the mouse, that is always in the same spot with respect to the ship. A stationary camera above the game environment was also tested. We found that a fixed camera that rotates with the ship was the most intuitive and fitting for the simplicity of the game.

We wanted to keep the controls simple. We considered side cannons for the player ship and the enemy ships, but this was not implemented due to increased difficulty when aiming. Instead the ships shoot from their fronts.

Along with gameplay changes, various graphical changes were also implemented, such as: how the water should behave in different environments to make it realistic but still fitting the cartoonish style of the game, and adjusting the detail present in the environment so the player sees the world through the eyes of a toy ship while not having too much detail that would slow down the game.

These changes were made either due to the evaluations the game received, or internal testing. The final implementation of each of these components will be discussed further in the following sections, as well as a brief overview of the evaluations received that caused various changes.
